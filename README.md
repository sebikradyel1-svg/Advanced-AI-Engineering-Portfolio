## 🤖 AI Engineering Projects (Production-Ready Python)
*Advanced implementations focusing on LLMs and Model Optimization.*

### 1. Enterprise HR RAG System
- **Core Tech:** LangChain, FAISS Vector DB, HuggingFace Embeddings.
- **Description:** A Retrieval-Augmented Generation system designed to query internal HR policies. It handles document chunking, vector indexing, and provides context-aware answers.
- **Key File:** `hr_rag_system_updated.py`

### 2. RLHF Alignment with KL-Guard
- **Core Tech:** PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), TRL, KL Divergence.
- **Description:** Implementation of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Features a manual KL-divergence guard to prevent model collapse during fine-tuning.
- **Key Files:** `KL_Guard_RLHF.py`, `reward_model_training.py`

### 3. Transformer-Based Stock Predictor
- **Core Tech:** TensorFlow, Multi-Head Attention, Positional Encoding.
- **Description:** A custom Transformer architecture built from scratch for time-series forecasting in financial markets.
- **Key File:** `transformer_stock_prediction.py`

## 📊 Data Science & Business Analytics (Jupyter Notebooks)
*Deep-dive analysis focusing on Business Intelligence and Predictive Modeling.*

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction System
- **Impact:** Identified high-risk customers in a 7,000+ client dataset with **ROC-AUC > 0.85**.
- **Tech:** Scikit-learn, Plotly, Feature Engineering.
- **File:** `churn_prediction_system.ipynb`

### 2. Marketing A/B Testing Optimization
- **Impact:** Used real-world digital marketing data to implement **Multi-Armed Bandit** algorithms and statistical significance testing (Chi-squared).
- **File:** `marketing_ab_real_data.ipynb`

### 3. Credit Risk Assessment
- **Impact:** Built a propensity scoring model for loan default prediction using Logistic Regression and LDA.
- **File:** `Credit_Risk_Prediction_v2.ipynb`
